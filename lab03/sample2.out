Shall I wither and fall like an autumn leav,
From this deep sorrow - from this painful grief?
How can I go on or find a way to be strong?
WillI ever again enjoy life's sweet song?

Sometimes a warm memory sheds light in the dark
And eases the pain like the song of a Meadow Lark.
Then it flits away on silent wing and I'm alone;
Hungering for more of the light it had shone.

Shall grief's biiter cold sadness consume me,
Like a winter storm on the vast angry sea?
How can I fill the void and deep desperate need
To replant my heart with hop's lovely seed?

Then I look at a photo of your playful smiling face
And for a moment I escape to a serene happy place;
Remembering the laughter and all your would do, 
Cherishing the honest, caring, loving spirit of you.

Shall spring's cheerful flowers bring life anew
And allow me to forget the agony of missing you?
Will spring's burst of new life bring fresh hope
And teach my grieving soul how to cope?

Somtimes I'll read a reasured card you had given me
And each word's special meaning makes me see,
The precious gift of love I was fortunate to receive,
And I realize you'd never want to see me grieve.

Shall summer's warm brilliant sun bring new light,
And free my anguished mind of its terrible plight?
Will its gentle breezes chase grief's dark clouds away,
And show me a clear path towards a better day?

When I visit the grave where you lie in eternal peace,
I know that death and heaven brought you release;
I try to envision your jow on that shore across the sea,
And, until I join you, that'll have to be enough for me.

For all the remaining seasons of my life on earch,
Ther'll be days I'll miss your merriment and mirth,
And sometimes I'll sadly long for all the yesterdays;
Missing our chats and your gentle understanding ways.

Yt, the lessons of kindness and love you taught me,
And the good things in life you've helped me to see;
Linger as lasting figts that comfort and will sustain,
Until I journy to the peaceful shore and see you again.
